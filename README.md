Trying to get star tracker working on Cloud 9 



load as a new Node workspace with this repository link

https://github.com/hpssjellis/phonegap-app-star-track.git

then run these two commands

npm install


npm start

then preview running app and use that URL to load Star Track on the Phonegap develper App.

Very Cool. Thanks for the help Tommy-Carlos Williams and your blog at

## Previewing the app

### Requirements

- PhoneGap CLI: `npm install -g phonegap`

### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-star-track
cd phonegap-app-star-track
phonegap serve
```

### Template

Alternatively, you can use the app as a template for the PhoneGap CLI:

```
phonegap create StarTrack --template https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-star-track
cd StarTrack
phonegap serve
```

### View

You can now view the app either in a browser at`localhost:3000`, or using the [PhoneGap Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com/) on your device(s).


Of course, all the other PhoneGap CLI commands work as expected.

```
phonegap platform add ios
phonegap run ios
cordova platform add android
cordova run android --device
```

etc...
